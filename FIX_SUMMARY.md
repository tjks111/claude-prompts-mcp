# GET Request Fix Summary

## Problem
The Railway deployment was showing 404 errors for GET requests to `/mcp` endpoint. The server only had POST handlers for MCP endpoints, but health checks and browser requests typically use GET.

## Root Cause
In the HTTP transport (`server/src/transport/http.ts`), only POST handlers were defined for:
- `/mcp` 
- `/messages`
- `/` (root)

When Railway or health check services made GET requests to these endpoints, they received 404 errors.

## Solution
Added GET handlers for the main endpoints that provide informational responses:

### `/mcp` GET Handler
Returns comprehensive server information including:
- Server name and version
- Transport type (http)
- Available endpoints and their usage
- Example MCP request format
- Usage instructions

### `/messages` GET Handler  
Returns endpoint information for the messages endpoint.

## Changes Made
1. **Modified `server/src/transport/http.ts`**:
   - Added GET handler for `/mcp` endpoint
   - Added GET handler for `/messages` endpoint
   - Maintained all existing POST functionality

## Testing
✅ GET `/mcp` - Returns server info (200 OK)
✅ GET `/messages` - Returns endpoint info (200 OK)  
✅ GET `/health` - Returns health status (200 OK)
✅ GET `/` - Returns basic server message (200 OK)
✅ POST `/mcp` - MCP protocol still works (200 OK)

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes 404 errors in Railway deployment logs
- ✅ Improves health check compatibility
- ✅ Better developer experience with informative GET responses
- ✅ Maintains full MCP protocol functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Railway Deployment
The fix is specifically beneficial for Railway deployments where:
- Health checks may use GET requests
- Load balancers may probe endpoints
- Developers may browse endpoints in browsers
- Monitoring services may check endpoint availability

The server will now respond properly to both GET (informational) and POST (MCP protocol) requests.

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Railway Configuration Updates
- **Updated `railway.json`**: Changed start command from `npm start` to `npm run start:railway`
- **Updated `railway-template.json`**: Added explicit start command for new deployments
- **Reason**: Ensures Railway uses HTTP transport with proper logging

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- **Transport Detection**: Added detailed logging for transport selection process
- **Health Check Logging**: Added IP and User-Agent logging for health checks
- **GET Request Logging**: Added detailed logging for all GET requests to MCP endpoints
- **Improved Health Response**: Added timestamp and uptime to health check response

### 3. Better Auto-Detection
- **Railway Environment Detection**: Improved detection of Railway environment variables
- **Fallback Logic**: Better fallback to default transport when auto-detection fails
- **Debug Information**: Added startup logging to help troubleshoot deployment issues

## Expected Results After Deployment

After redeploying to Railway, you should see:

1. **Health Check Logs**: GET requests to `/health` should appear in Railway logs
2. **Startup Logs**: Transport detection messages should show HTTP transport selection
3. **No More 404s**: GET requests to `/mcp` and `/messages` should return 200 OK
4. **Better Monitoring**: Health checks should include timestamp and uptime information

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy to Railway**: The changes need to be deployed to take effect
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway logs for the new startup messages and health checks
3. **Verify Endpoints**: Test GET requests to `/health`, `/mcp`, and `/messages` endpoints
4. **Confirm MCP Functionality**: Ensure POST requests to MCP endpoints still work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see GET requests in logs after deployment:

1. **Check Railway Environment**: Verify `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` and `PORT` variables are set
2. **Verify Start Command**: Ensure Railway is using `npm run start:railway`
3. **Check Health Check Settings**: Verify Railway health check is configured for `/health`
4. **Review Startup Logs**: Look for transport detection messages in deployment logs
