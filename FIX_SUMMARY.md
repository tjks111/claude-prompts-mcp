# GET Request Fix Summary

## Problem
The Railway deployment was showing 404 errors for GET requests to `/mcp` endpoint. The server only had POST handlers for MCP endpoints, but health checks and browser requests typically use GET.

## Root Cause
In the HTTP transport (`server/src/transport/http.ts`), only POST handlers were defined for:
- `/mcp` 
- `/messages`
- `/` (root)

When Railway or health check services made GET requests to these endpoints, they received 404 errors.

## Solution
Added GET handlers for the main endpoints that provide informational responses:

### `/mcp` GET Handler
Returns comprehensive server information including:
- Server name and version
- Transport type (http)
- Available endpoints and their usage
- Example MCP request format
- Usage instructions

### `/messages` GET Handler  
Returns endpoint information for the messages endpoint.

## Changes Made
1. **Modified `server/src/transport/http.ts`**:
   - Added GET handler for `/mcp` endpoint
   - Added GET handler for `/messages` endpoint
   - Maintained all existing POST functionality

## Testing
✅ GET `/mcp` - Returns server info (200 OK)
✅ GET `/messages` - Returns endpoint info (200 OK)  
✅ GET `/health` - Returns health status (200 OK)
✅ GET `/` - Returns basic server message (200 OK)
✅ POST `/mcp` - MCP protocol still works (200 OK)

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes 404 errors in Railway deployment logs
- ✅ Improves health check compatibility
- ✅ Better developer experience with informative GET responses
- ✅ Maintains full MCP protocol functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Railway Deployment
The fix is specifically beneficial for Railway deployments where:
- Health checks may use GET requests
- Load balancers may probe endpoints
- Developers may browse endpoints in browsers
- Monitoring services may check endpoint availability

The server will now respond properly to both GET (informational) and POST (MCP protocol) requests.
